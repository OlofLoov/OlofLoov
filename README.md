## Recent :computer: stuff
[Coloring pages app](https://github.com/OlofLoov/OlofLoov/blob/master/coloring-pages.png) 
<br />
Inspired by my own child’s love for coloring, i created a Next.js application that generates unique drawings for kids to color.
The app uses a custom made LoRa model of SDXL hosted at replicate.ai and Supabase for authentication, storage, and a PostgreSQL database.

[AI Podcast Creator](https://open.spotify.com/show/1kDCSlulzBsD5T3JFg0irN?si=1f796da21d9e42d9)
<br/>
A simple weather podcast generator that automates the creation of daily weather updates. It fetches weather data from a public API, utilizes OpenAI's language model to transform the raw JSON data into a natural-sounding broadcast script, and then employs ElevenLabs for speech synthesis to generate the podcast in audio format. The result is a fully automated weather podcast that provides clear and engaging updates.
